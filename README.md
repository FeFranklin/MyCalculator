<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

Simple calculator built with HTML, JS and CSS plus some bootsrap for responsiveness.

* [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JS](https://www.javascript.com/)
